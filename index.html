        Malcolm James McCormick (January 19, 1992 – September 7, 2018), known
        professionally as Mac Miller, was an American rapper and record
        producer. Miller began his career in Pittsburgh's hip hop scene in 2007,
        at the age of fifteen. In 2010, he signed a record deal with independent
        label Rostrum Records and released his breakthrough mixtapes K.I.D.S.
        (2010) and Best Day Ever (2011). Miller's debut studio album, Blue Slide
        Park (2011), became the first independently distributed debut album to
        top the US Billboard 200 since 1995.
